# Understanding Depression in Teens

## What is Depression?

Depression is more than just feeling sad or having a bad day. It's a real medical condition that affects your thoughts, feelings, physical health, and behavior. Depression makes it hard to function in daily life and can last for weeks, months, or longer without treatment.

## Important: Depression is NOT Your Fault

- It's not a sign of weakness
- It's not something you can just "snap out of"
- It's not because you're not trying hard enough
- It's a treatable medical condition
- You deserve help and support

## Signs and Symptoms of Depression

- Feeling hopeless or pessimistic
- Feeling worthless or guilty
- Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Irritability or anger (especially in teens)
- Difficulty feeling happy even about good things
- Feeling numb or empty

### Physical Symptoms

## What Causes Teen Depression?

Depression doesn't have one single cause. It can be triggered by:

### Biological Factors

- Hormonal changes during puberty
- Family history of depression
- Chronic illness or pain

### Life Circumstances
- Bullying or social rejection
- Academic pressure or failure
- Family problems or divorce
- Loss of a loved one
- Trauma or abuse
- Major life changes

### Other Contributors
- Social media and online comparison
- Lack of sleep

## What Depression Feels Like

Teens with depression often describe it as:
- "Like there's a heavy weight on my chest"
- "Everything feels gray and empty"
- "I'm exhausted but can't sleep"
- "Nothing seems worth the effort"
- "I feel disconnected from everyone"
- "I'm just going through the motions"
- "I feel alone even in a crowd"

## Self-Care Strategies

While professional help is important, these can support recovery:

## What NOT to Do

Avoid these common but unhelpful responses:

## How to Talk About Depression

### To a Trusted Adult
- "I've been feeling really down lately and I need help"

### To a Friend

You don't have to explain everything at once. Just start the conversation.
