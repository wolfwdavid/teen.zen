## Grounding Techniques (5-4-3-2-1 Method)

When anxiety hits, use your senses to ground yourself:
- **5 things you can SEE** (look around - a pen, plant, picture, etc.)
- **4 things you can TOUCH** (your clothes, table, phone, chair)
- **3 things you can HEAR** (birds, traffic, music, your breathing)
- **2 things you can SMELL** (coffee, fresh air, lotion)
- **1 thing you can TASTE** (gum, drink water, notice your mouth)

This brings you back to the present moment.

## Breathing Techniques for Anxiety

- Hold for 4 counts

- Hold for 4 counts
- Repeat 4 times

### Belly Breathing
- Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly
- Breathe in slowly through your nose (belly should expand)
- Breathe out slowly through your mouth
- Focus on making your belly move more than your chest

## Cognitive Strategies

### Challenge Anxious Thoughts
Ask yourself:
- Is this thought based on facts or feelings?
- What evidence do I have?
- What would I tell a friend in this situation?
- What's the worst that could happen? Could I handle it?
- Am I catastrophizing (assuming the worst)?

### Reframe Negative Thoughts
- Instead of "I'll fail this test" → "I've studied and I'll do my best"
- Instead of "Everyone will judge me" → "Most people are focused on themselves"
- Instead of "I can't do this" → "This is hard, but I can try"

## Lifestyle Changes That Help

### Regular Exercise
- Releases anxiety-reducing chemicals in your brain
- Even 20 minutes of walking helps
- Team sports provide social connection
- Yoga combines movement and breathing

### Sleep Hygiene
- Stick to a regular sleep schedule
- Create a calming bedtime routine
- Avoid screens before bed
- Keep your room cool and dark

### Limit Caffeine
- Energy drinks and coffee can increase anxiety
- Try herbal tea or water instead
- Check labels - caffeine is in sodas and chocolate too

- Turn off non-essential notifications
- Have phone-free time each day

These might feel helpful but make anxiety worse:

## Creating an Anxiety Action Plan

1. **Recognize your triggers** - What situations cause anxiety?
2. **Identify warning signs** - How does your body signal anxiety?
3. **Choose coping strategies** - What works best for you?
4. **Build a support network** - Who can you talk to?
5. **Practice regularly** - Use techniques before you need them
