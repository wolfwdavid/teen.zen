## Creating Your Self-Care Plan

Self-care is important but isn't a replacement for professional help. Seek support if:
- Self-care isn't helping
- Symptoms are getting worse
- Daily functioning is impaired
- You're having thoughts of self-harm
- Friends/family are concerned
- You've been struggling for weeks

## Remember

- Self-care is a practice, not perfection
- What works for others might not work for you
- Your needs change - that's okay
- Small consistent actions matter most
- It's okay to need help
- You deserve care and kindness
- Taking care of yourself helps you take care of others

## Emergency Self-Care

When everything feels overwhelming:
1. Breathe (just 5 deep breaths)
2. Drink water
3. Eat something if hungry
4. Move your body (even just stretch)
5. Reach out to someone
6. Do one small thing for yourself

Start where you are. Do what you can. Be kind to yourself. Every small act of self-care counts.
