# Stress Management for Teens

## What is Stress?

Stress is your body's natural response to challenges, changes, or demands in your life. It's completely normal to feel stressed sometimes, especially during teenage years when you're dealing with school, relationships, family expectations, and figuring out who you are.

## Common Sources of Teen Stress

- Academic pressure and exams
- Social situations and peer relationships
- Family conflicts or changes
- Body image and appearance concerns
- Future planning and college decisions
- Social media and online pressure
- Time management challenges
- Romantic relationships

## Physical Signs of Stress

Your body tells you when you're stressed:
- Headaches or muscle tension
- Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
- Changes in appetite
- Feeling tired all the time
- Stomach problems
- Getting sick more often

## Emotional Signs of Stress

- Feeling overwhelmed or irritable
- Anxiety or worry
- Mood swings
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feeling unmotivated
- Withdrawing from friends and activities

## Healthy Coping Strategies

### 1. Physical Activity
Exercise releases endorphins that improve your mood. Try:
- Going for a walk or run
- Playing sports
- Dancing to your favorite music
- Yoga or stretching
- Even just 10-15 minutes helps!

### 2. Breathing Exercises
Try the 4-7-8 technique:
- Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts
- Hold your breath for 7 counts
- Breathe out through your mouth for 8 counts
- Repeat 3-4 times

### 3. Talk to Someone
Don't keep stress bottled up:
- Talk to a trusted friend or family member
- Reach out to a school counselor
- Call a teen helpline if you need someone to listen
- Sometimes just saying it out loud helps

### 4. Time Management
Break big tasks into smaller steps:
- Use a planner or phone calendar
- Set realistic goals
- Prioritize what's most important
- Take breaks between study sessions
- Don't procrastinate (it makes stress worse!)

### 5. Self-Care Activities
Make time for things you enjoy:
- Listen to music
- Read a book
- Draw or do creative activities
- Spend time in nature
- Take a relaxing bath
- Watch your favorite show

### 6. Limit Social Media
Too much screen time can increase stress:
- Set time limits on apps
- Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad
- Remember: people only post their highlights, not reality
- Take regular social media breaks

### 7. Get Enough Sleep
Teens need 8-10 hours of sleep:
- Keep a regular sleep schedule
- Turn off screens 1 hour before bed
- Make your room cool, dark, and quiet
- Avoid caffeine in the evening

### 8. Healthy Eating
Food affects your mood:
- Eat regular meals
- Include fruits and vegetables
- Drink plenty of water
- Limit junk food and energy drinks
- Don't skip breakfast

## Quick Stress Relief Techniques

When you need immediate relief:
- Count to 10 slowly
- Squeeze a stress ball
- Listen to calming music
- Step outside for fresh air
- Do a quick stretching routine
- Text a friend
- Pet an animal if you have one

## When to Seek More Help

It's important to talk to a professional if:
- Stress is affecting your daily life
- You're having trouble sleeping for weeks
- You feel depressed or hopeless
- You're using substances to cope
- You have thoughts of hurting yourself
- Your grades are dropping significantly
- You're withdrawing from everything you used to enjoy

## Important Reminders

- It's okay to not be perfect
- Everyone feels stressed sometimes
- Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness
- Small steps count - you don't have to change everything at once
- Be patient with yourself
- You deserve to feel better
